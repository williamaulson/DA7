<h2>Escape!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Escape! is  game where you avoid guards an escape to freedom.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should experience a sense of urgency as they play as many game events are timed or require timing skills. Players should feel a sense of satisfaction for completing the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This game can be considered a hybrid of stealth and timing-puzzle genres.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Players can control the avatar character by using the arrow keys to move in eight directions. Players need to navigate through the rooms by pressing buttons which open doors needed to escape the play area. Doors must be reached within 10 seconds of opening them otherwise they will close and need to be opened again via button. Players have unlimited attempts to escape due to the avatar's precognition ability.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The primary mechanic this prototype is evaluating is timing-based movement. Players need to decide when to move their character so that they will not be killed by guards but must also do so quickly to avoid doors closing. By using a single game screen players can study the behavior of the guards to help with their actions.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The precognition mechanic of the game emulates the ability to view potential future actions and their consequences. Their is gratuitous blood upon an avatar's death which can appeal to gore-inclined demographics. The game requires skill and good timing but is short enough that anyone can beat it with some persistence.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game setting is a world preparing for a massive World War. Governments have authorized numerous research facilities to experiment upon human beings and animals in the hopes of creating or discovering something that will ensure their victory in the upcoming war.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You are the avatar. A human taken from your home and imprisoned in an underground research facility. After being subjected to numerous medical experiments you realize you have developed the ability to see possible future events before they occur. Suddenly the door to your cell opens. Can you use your newfound ability to escape this horrific place?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The game is short with mild-adult subject matter so its target demographic should be anyone over the age of 12 looking for a short game session.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
The game can be beaten in as little time as a minute. Less skilled players should take no more than 5 minutes to beat the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The movement speed of the two guards is different and switches when buttons are activated. Players can use this information to manipulate the speed of the guards by activating the same button. This can be used to align the two guards on a similar patrol path which would make it easier beat the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Green arrow taken from Google Image search. Avatar and NPC characters are from official Phaser tutorial. All other images created by internal design team. Audio taken from video games and public domain sound sources.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
There is no game that I feel directly influences this game because the mechanics are very common to video games. I was influenced somewhat by the Adventures of Lolo games.
